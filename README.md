# CS336 Spring 2024 Assignment 4 (Data) Leaderboard

To submit to the leaderboard, submit a pull request that adds your results to
the Markdown table below. The table should be sorted by increasing loss.

Note that your submission can run for at most 24 hours on 2 H100s, and that you
must evaluate on the C4 100 domains dataset that we provide. In addition, your
data should be exclusively filtered from the common crawl WARC files that we
provide.

In your pull request description, you should include:

- The final validation loss that was recorded
- A link to an associated learning curve. You may either upload an image
  directly to the repo (use the [./images](./images)) folder or link to a
  publicly-viewable plot from a service like Weights and Biases.
- A description of what you did / how you built your dataset.
